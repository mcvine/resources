Summary
-------

This was a simulation of the beam for an 4He experiment
using finest (so far) fermi chopper for ARCS: 700-0.5-AST.

This was difficult because the needed accuracy of simulated
resolution is very high: about ~1% of the total width.
A simulation with all default values for parameters is not
enough.
Various changes were made and details are below.

Modified emission time:

  $ mcvine instruments arcs m2s --fermi_chopper=700-0.5-AST --fermi_nu=600 --T0_nu=180 --E=686.62 --emission_time=3.8 --- -dump-pml=yes -h

See the emission_time option. 3.8 mus was taken from experimental reduction
summary.


Modified two components: Moderator and FermiChopper

Moderator
---------

Analytical moderator from Franz

* filename: the absolute path to the data file for Beamline #17 (SEQUOIA and ARCS share a moderator). this has to be updated!!!
* proton_T: from literature. about 0.7
* sample_E: 1 means sample uniformly in E range
* sample_t: 0 means sample using the probability distribution


FermiChopper
------------

McStas standard Fermi Chopper

* Curvature of fc: 1/1.5043
* by default FermiChopper component is rotating CW looking from above.
  Same as Fermi_chop2 component. So no need to rotate the fermi chopper


Validation
----------

This simulation was done with Souleymane on a 4He ARCS experiment,
and the beam simulation here reproduced the experimental
resolution well


Known Problems
--------------

This version of analytical moderator does not support
"moderator angling" and it is not included.
The effect of "moderator angling" on this dataset is small,
and is compensated by narrowing down the Fermi chopper slit
width a bit to match the monitors.
